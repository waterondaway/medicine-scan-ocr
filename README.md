# Drug Label Recognition System (Final Year Project)

## Overview
This repository contains the final year project for my Bachelor's degree at [University Name]. The project focuses on developing a system for recognizing and managing drug labels using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Models (LLM). The project includes both an application and a web-based management system to facilitate drug label recognition, data processing, and management.

### Key Features
- **OCR-based Drug Label Recognition**: Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from drug labels.
- **Web Management System**: A web-based interface for managing and processing drug label data, including dataset handling and label management.
- **Application Development**: A mobile or desktop application (depending on implementation) for real-time drug label recognition using OCR technology.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: Enhances data processing and interpretation through the integration of a Large Language Model, offering better context understanding for label information.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several parts:
1. **Dataset**: A collection of synthetic and real drug label images used for training the OCR model.
2. **OCR Module**: The core module that extracts text from drug label images using machine learning algorithms.
3. **Web System**: A web interface to manage datasets, process images, and store results.
4. **LLM Integration**: Using a large language model to assist in understanding the context of the drug label data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
