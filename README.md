# OCR Performance Evaluation System (Final Year Project)

## Overview
This repository contains the final year project for my Bachelor's degree at Kasetsart University. The project focuses on developing a system for evaluating the performance of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in extracting text from drug labels. The system includes a benchmarking framework, dataset generation, and performance metrics to assess OCR model accuracy and efficiency.

### Key Features
- **OCR-based Drug Label Recognition**: Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from drug labels.
- **Web Management System**: A web-based interface for managing and processing drug label data, including dataset handling and label management.
- **Application Development**: A mobile or desktop application (depending on implementation) for real-time drug label recognition using OCR technology.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: Enhances data processing and interpretation through the integration of a Large Language Model, offering better context understanding for label information.

- **OCR Model Evaluation**: Compares the performance of various OCR models on drug label datasets.
- **Benchmarking Framework**: Provides a structured approach to evaluate OCR models using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and speed.
- **Synthetic and Real Datasets**: Utilizes a combination of real-world and synthetically generated drug label images for testing and evaluation.
- **Performance Reports**: Generates detailed reports to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
